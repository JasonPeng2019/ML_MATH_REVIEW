can you read my PRML_textbook.pdf's Ch. 1.1, then create sufficiently long latex code output that covers all the important concepts, derivations, and would give somebody the fundamental understanding that the chapter gives even if that person didn't read the chapter? Include all math derivations, all theorems, and all noteworthy conceptual explanations. The document should cover everything important thoroughly, but also not go into excess information that isn't efficient to put down. The document could be anywhere from 4 - 30 pages, it's your choice to make it as long as you think it needs to be.
